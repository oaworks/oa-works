      <h1>Hi, we’re so glad you’re here 👋</h1>

      <p>We need your help, things aren’t going well.</p>

      <p>Society’s informational (and environmental, political) ecosystems are collapsing. The answers to those problems are paywalled, and most people around the world aren’t even able to share what they know.</p>

      <p>We’re working with libraries, scholars, educators, and the people who fund them to change that. To make sure that academic papers and the research that supports them can be read openly, used easily, and published freely. To make sure that how we share information together is rooted in justice and kindness.</p>

      {% include 'partners.html' %}

      <p>Recently, we’ve built tools like ShareYourPaper.org that makes it simple to freely and legally unlock your paper from behind it’s paywall. We’ve helped build a new global network of libraries sharing knowledge freely during COVID through RSCVD. Our tools like InstantILL and Open Access Button are support libraries and authors getting the research they need without a bill they can’t afford. They’ve been used millions of times, across the globe.</p>

      <p>OA.Works was founded in frustration at this broken system. But today, behind our work is a strong set of partners, our small but mighty team, and the values we hold dear. We’re fortunate as hell to work with incredible partners with the support of leading funders.</p>

      <p>We’re OA.Works, and that’s our job, to make Open Access Work. So, please join us.</p>
