This accessibility statement applies to the present OA.Works website and excludes our individual product websites ([OAbutton.org](https://oabutton.org), [InstantILL.org](https://instantill.org), [ShareYourPaper.org](https://shareyourpaper.org)) and our [blog](https://blog.oa.works/).

This website is run by OA.Works. Our organization is committed to accessibility and inclusivity for all people with disabilities. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen.
- Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.
- Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.
- Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).

We’ve also made the website text as easy as possible to understand using Simple English (US).

We continue to improve the website’s accessibility and performance for as many devices as possible. We do not, however, support Internet Explorer.

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Measures to support accessibility

OA.Works takes the following measures to ensure accessibility of OA.Works’ website:

- Included accessibility throughout our internal policies.
- Appointed an accessibility officer.
- Assigned accessibility goals and responsibilities.

## Conformance status

OA.Works is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d).

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.

OA.Works’ website is **partially conformant with WCAG 2.1 level AA**. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

This statement was prepared on July 26, 2021. It was last reviewed on **May 19, 2022**. This website was last tested on August 4, 2021.

- Fixed on May 19, 2022:
   - You can’t skip to the main content when using a screen reader. [Github issue](https://github.com/oaworks/oa-works/issues/126)
   - Some images, in particular in the blog post previews on the homepage, may not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. [Github issue](https://github.com/oaworks/oa-works/issues/128) 

The test was carried out by our own team at OA.Works using:

- Automated tools: [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), and an HTML outliner.
- Manual testing: MacOs’ VoiceOver and just the keyboard.

We used the open-source, automated tool [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to help assess accessibility and generate reports. The tool partially covers WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements.
