## Changes to Our Policies

This policy is current as of February 27th, 2020. Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. However, any revised privacy policy will be consistent with our mission. If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will place notice in our blog, post notice of changes on this page, and email users.

### Updates

- MONTH DAY 2025: Updated to replace references to New Venture Fund with Code for Science & Society
- April 28th 2021: Updated the name "Open Access Button" throughout to reflect our new name. We did not post notices as this wasn't deemed a substantial change.
- February 27th 2020: Updated terms with an additional standard disclaimer to support Shareyourpaper.org. We did not post notices as this wasn't deemed a substantial change, and users of that service will be asked to accept these separately.
- October 24th, 2016: Updated text to remove references to passwords. We no longer have them in favour of a more secure password less system. This page structure was also updated to mimic our privacy policy so there is now a clear place to ask questions and understand our update policy. We also cleaned up some formatting and removed the "welcome message" at the start of the policy. This was not posted to our blog as it wasn't deemed a substantial change.
